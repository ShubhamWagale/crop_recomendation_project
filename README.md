# Precision Agriculture Crop Recommendation


This project aims to design and implement a machine learning model for precision agriculture that predicts the most suitable crops to grow in a particular farm based on various environmental parameters including soil content (N, P, K), temperature, humidity, pH value, and rainfall. The goal is to maximize agricultural yield by recommending optimal crop types tailored to the specific conditions of individual farms.

## Dataset
The [Crop Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/siddharthss/crop-recommendation-dataset/data) is taken from Kaggle and it contains the fields:
```markdown
N: Ratio of Nitrogen content in soil
P: Ratio of Phosphorous content in soil
K: Ratio of Potassium content in soil
temperature: Temperature in degree Celsius
humidity: Relative humidity in percentage
ph: pH value of the soil
rainfall: Rainfall in mm
Label: Type of crop
```

## Installation

To get started with the project, clone the repository and install the necessary dependencies:


```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/precision-agriculture-crop-prediction.git

cd precision-agriculture-crop-prediction

pip install -r requirements.txt

```
    
## Results
```markdown
The model predicts the optimal crop types based on environmental parameters with high accuracy.
The loss curves and evaluation metrics indicate the model's robustness and generalization capability.
```
## Future Work

```markdown
-Experiment with other machine learning algorithms such as decision trees and random forests.
-Incorporate additional environmental parameters for more accurate predictions.
-Develop a user-friendly interface for farmers to input data and get crop recommendations.
```
